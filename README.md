# fpgaConvNet HLS

This repository is part of the fpgaConvNet framework, designed to solve the complex mapping problem of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) onto Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices.
The HLS repository contains the hardware implementation of CNN building blocks, and performs the mapping automation of a CNN model description to hardware.

%% This is CNN-to-FPGA mapping framework designed to find the optimal implementation of a CNN architecture on an FPGA for power, latency and throughput driven designs.

## Requirements

The following programs are required:

1. Vivado HLS
2. python (>=3.8)

Once these programs are installed, you can setup the project from pypi:

```
python -m pip install fpgaconvnet-hls
```
